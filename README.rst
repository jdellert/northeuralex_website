NorthEuraLex: website
=====================

In this repo lives the web interface to the NorthEuraLex database
(`northeuralex.org`_). It is a `clld`_ app.


setup
=====

::
    This update is intended for use with Python3.7

    # clone this repository
    git clone https://github.com/evolaemp/northeuralex_website
    cd northeuralex_website

    # you do not need to create a virtual env if you know what you are doing
    # note that this is a python 3 project
    pyvenv path/to/my/venv
    source path/to/my/venv/bin/activate

    # install wheel to asist in installing dependencies
    # install the dependencies (there are quite a few of these)
    # it is important to use the versions specified in the requirements file
    # requirements.txt has been updated for Python3.7
    pip install wheel
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # clld wants its projects to be python packages, so you have to register
    # the northeuralex package with the virtual env
    python setup.py develop

    # in a development setup the database is an sqlite3 instance living in meta
    mkdir meta
    python northeuralex/scripts/initializedb.py development.ini --module northeuralex path/to/northeuralex_data path/to/lang_data

    # check the unit tests
    python setup.py test

    # run the development server at localhost:6543
    pserve --reload development.ini


There are certain strings in clld's default templates that can be changed
through localisation. If you want to change one of those strings, you need to
add them in ``northeuralex/__init__.py`` and then do something like this::

    pybabel extract northeuralex -o northeuralex/locale/northeuralex.pot
    pybabel init -i northeuralex/locale/northeuralex.pot -d northeuralex/locale -D clld -l en

    vim northeuralex/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/clld.po

    pybabel compile -d northeuralex/locale -D clld --statistics
    pybabel update -i northeuralex/locale/northeuralex.pot -d northeuralex/locale -D clld --previous
